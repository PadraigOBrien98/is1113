            		<p> 
            		Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
            		An example of SaaS would be Salesforce. Here is a link to the Salesforce website.

            			<h3>Platform as a Service</h3>
            			<p>
            		Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware, database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.
            		Cloud 9 IDE is an example of Platform as a service. Here is a link to the Cloud 9 website.

            			<h3>Infrastructure as a service.</h3>
            			<p>
            				Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware.
            				Amazon is an example of Infrastructure as a service. Here is a link the Amazon website.

            		    <h3>Communication as a service</h3>
            		    <p>
            		        Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP , instant messaging , collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
