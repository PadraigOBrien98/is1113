My favourite sport is Hurling
        </h3>
        <br>
        
        I have been playing hurling for 16 years with Midleton GAA. I also played for my school, Midleton CBS, and now I play for UCC.
        I have represented Cork at u14 to u16 in both Hurling and Football. I have won an All Ireland final and 3 Munster finals aswell.
        
       <strong> Here is a picture of me as Captain for my school.</strong>

       <h3>
           
               Another sport that I enjoy is American Football.
          
       </h3>
       <br>
       <p>
           I have been following American Football since I was 10. My favourite team is the New York Jets.
           In 2015 I went to an American Football match in Wembley Stadium,it was an amazing experience.

       <h3>
            I also love Rugby
           <br>
           </h3>
           <p> I used to play rugby when I was younger for my local rugby club Midleton RFC.
           I loved playing it but I had to stop when I was 13 because of an injury to my hip.
           I always go to Munster matches and this year I will be at the Champions cup final if Munster get to it.</p>
