		</h2>
		<p align="center">
		    Out of all the countries that i have visited my favourite has to be the USA. I have been to the USA twice, once to Orlando and to New York City.
		    I went to New York when I was in Transition Year. To this day I am still in awe of the city and how different it is to Ireland
		    My favourite part of New York was Times Square. Times Square is one of the most amazing places I've ever visited.

		            The country that I have visited the most is Spain. I have been to Spain 6 times. I have been to Salou 3 times. Salou is located 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Barcalona on the east coast.
		            Every time I go to Salou I go to Port Aventura theme park which is 10 minutes outside the city of Salou. Port Aventura is home to the fastest rollercoaster in Europe and the tallest free falling ride in the world!

		            I have lived in Ireland all of my life. 
		            I live in a town called Midleton in County Cork. 
		            Ireland is an island in West Europe. It is known for it's green fields and for the beautiful scenery. 
		            Millions of people visit Ireland every year to see attractions like the Cliffs of Moher in Clare and the Book of Kells in Trinity College, Dublin.
